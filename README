OVERVIEW
========

procwait is a program that allows to wait for a process identified by PID to
die. It is analoguous to `wait` but can be used to wait any process to
terminate, not only its children. When the tracked process terminates, procwait
terminates too.

procwait is a Linux program written in C.


COMPILING, INSTALLING AND UNINSTALLING
======================================

The intended workflow expects a `make` utility. Edit the Makefile to set the
compiling parameter to suit your system, it's short and clean. To build the
program run

    $ make

The Makefile also has 'install' and 'uninstall' targets. After you have
adjusted the Makefile variables and build the program you can install it by
issuing

    $ make install

and uninstall with

    $ make unintall


DOCUMENTATION
=============

For additional information about the program usage and options see the procwait
manpage.


BUGS
====
