PROCWAIT
========

Procwait is a Linux program written in C. It allows to wait for a process
identified by PID to die. It is analoguous to `wait` but can be used to wait
any process to terminate, not only its children. When the tracked process
terminates, procwait terminates too.


COMPILING, INSTALLING AND UNINSTALLING
--------------------------------------

The intended workflow expects a `make` utility. Edit the Makefile to set the
compiling parameter to suit your system, it's short and clean. To build the
program run

    $ make

The Makefile also has 'install' and 'uninstall' targets. After you have
adjusted the Makefile variables and build the program you can install it by
issuing

    $ make install

and uninstall with

    $ make uninstall


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

For additional information about the program usage and options see the procwait
