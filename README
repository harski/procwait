PROCWAIT
========

Procwait is a Linux program written in C. It allows to wait for a process
identified by process ID to die. It is analoguous to *wait* but can be used to
wait any process to terminate instead of its children. When the tracked process
terminates, procwait terminates too.


COMPILING, INSTALLING AND UNINSTALLING
--------------------------------------

The intended workflow expects a *make* utility. Edit the config.mk file to suit
your system. To build the program run

    $ make

The Makefile also has *install* and *uninstall* targets. After you have
adjusted the variables in config.mk and build the program you can install it by
issuing

    $ make install

and uninstall with

    $ make uninstall


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

For additional information about the program usage and options see the procwait
manpage procwait.1. Man page is generated when you build to program or issue

   $ make procwait.1
