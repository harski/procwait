PROCWAIT
========

Procwait allows to wait for processes identified by process IDs to die. It is
analogous to *wait* but can be used to wait any process to terminate instead of
only its own child processes. When all the tracked process terminates, procwait
terminates too. Procwait is a Linux program written in C.


HOW IT WORKS
------------

A process is perceived to be running if there exists a directory called
/proc/PID. Simply relying on polling whether the directory still exists is racy,
however: the tracked process can terminate and a new process can spawn with the
same PID before the directory is polled again. It may not be very likely in most
use-cases as there are /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max available PIDs, but possible.

When procwait is started the name of the tracked processes and their start times
are saved. To reduce the possibility of a race conditions the contents of
/proc/PID/stat is read every time a process is polled, and if the process' start
time or the process' name doesn't match to the information saved during procwait
startup the process is considered to have changed and thus the tracked process
is considered to have terminated.


COMPILING, INSTALLING AND UNINSTALLING
--------------------------------------

The intended workflow expects a *make* utility. Edit the config.mk file to suit
your system. To build the program run

    $ make

The Makefile also has *install* and *uninstall* targets. After you have
adjusted the variables in config.mk and build the program you can install it by
issuing

    $ make install

and uninstall with

    $ make uninstall


USAGE
-----

For information about the program usage and options see the procwait manpage
procwait.1. Man page is generated when you build to program or issue

   $ make procwait.1
